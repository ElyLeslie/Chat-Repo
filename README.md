## Description: 
* This site will allow for character customization. You'll be able to enter your name, choose a color, and then the site will remember your name and the color associated with that name. You can select your race, class, and specify your character's bio if desired. It will save everything. Once you have your bio, race, class, name, and color specified, it will remember it all, and you will be able to play and write as much as you'd like as that character. It will take you to what appears to be another page, where you will be able to write out your own story with a friend as a character.
